**📌 Mastering Lines & Indentation in Python 🐍**

In this section, we dive deep into how Python manages lines and indentation—an essential concept that dictates code structure and readability.

### **🧩 Logical vs. Physical Lines**
A Python script consists of **logical lines**, each composed of one or more **physical lines**:
✅ **Physical Line**: What appears as a single line in the editor.
✅ **Logical Line**: A meaningful instruction, potentially spanning multiple physical lines.

**🔹 Commenting Best Practices**
- Comments begin with a `#` and extend to the end of the line.
- Python ignores everything after the `#`, making comments essential for code documentation.

📌 **Example:**
```python
x = 10  # Assigns 10 to x
y = 20  # This is a comment, ignored by Python
```

---

### **📏 Blank Lines & Readability**
- A blank line contains only whitespace or a comment.
- Python **ignores blank lines**, making them a great way to separate logical sections and improve readability.

### **🚀 Statement Termination in Python**
Unlike other languages, **Python does not require a semicolon (`;`)** at the end of a statement.

**🔹 Handling Long Statements**
When a statement is too lengthy:
1️⃣ **Use a backslash (`\`)** to split across lines.
2️⃣ **Use parentheses (`()`), brackets (`[]`), or braces (`{}`)** for automatic line joining.

📌 **Examples:**
```python
# Using a backslash to continue the statement
total = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
        4 + 5 + 6

# Using parentheses for implicit continuation
total = (1 + 2 + 3 +
         4 + 5 + 6)
```

### **📜 Triple-Quoted Strings**
**Multi-line string literals** allow text to span multiple lines **without needing backslashes (`\`)**.

📌 **Example:**
```python
text = """This is a long string
spanning multiple lines."""
```

---

### **➡️ Continuation Lines & Block Structure**
Continuation lines follow the first physical line in a logical statement, but **indentation applies only to the first line**.

**🔹 Python Uses Indentation Instead of Braces `{}`**
- Indentation defines **code blocks**, unlike other languages that use braces `{}`.
- A **block ends** when the indentation level decreases.

📌 **Example:**
```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
    y = x
else:
    print("Non-positive number")
    y = 0
```

---

### **📝 Important Indentation Rules**
❌ The **first statement** in a Python file **must not** be indented.
❌ **Interactive mode (`>>>`)** statements must also **not** be indented.

---

### **🌟 Best Practices for Indentation**
✅ **Use 4 spaces per indentation level** (recommended by [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)).
❌ **Never mix tabs & spaces**, as different environments interpret them differently.
🔹 Use **`-t` and `-tt`** options in Python to enforce consistent indentation.
🔹 Python 3 **strictly prohibits** mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.

---

### **💡 Pro Tip for Developers**
🛠️ **Configure your code editor** to replace tabs with 4 spaces to maintain consistency.

📌 **Example (Correct Indentation):**
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # ✅ Correct: 4 spaces per indentation level
```
